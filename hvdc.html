	<h2>HVDC</h2><div>
	<p id="para-1"  > hvdc tarnsmission is a system that transmits energy over a certain distance at a high voltage and in Direct current form through over head conductors or submarine conductors</p>
	<div><h2>advantages of hvdc</h2></div> 
	<ol>
		<li>There are less corona losses in HVDC transmission</li>
		<li>No proximity and skin effect with DC transmission</li>
		<li>Due to reduced dielectric losses, the current carrying capacity of HVDC cable is largeCompared to AC transmission</li>
		<li>Less insulating devices are required compared to AC th</li>
		<li>switching surges are lower in DC</li>
		<li>he radio interference and the corona power loss are less
</li>

		<li id="b">symetrical faults</li>
	</ol>
	<p id="para-2">symetrical faults rearly occur and are the most severe ones, they impose heavy duty on the circuit breaker, these give rise to symetrical fault currents and can be analysed using posigive sequence components.<br> unsysmetrical faults are the most common ones and most of the are transient in nature</p>

<p><b> Short circuit capacity of the connected AC grid is important for the selection of converter. Since the mismatch of power injection is compensated by the DC voltage controlling station, there could be sudden change in the power set-points. </b> <br>  Hence, if the short circuit capacity of the connected AC grid is low, then there occurs some disturbance in the AC grid every time the power set-point is changed. In case the short circuit capacity of the DC voltage controlling station is high enough, then the change in set-points in the power to compensate for the mismatch in DC grid will not have any effect on the AC grid</p>
