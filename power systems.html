	<h1>power system stability</h1>
	<hr>

	<p> <b> Power system stability</b> is the property of a power
system that enables it to remain in a state of operating
equilibrium under normal operating conditions and to
regain an acceptable state of equilibrium after being
subjected to a
disturbance.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>transient stability</li>
		<li>rotor angle stability.</li>

	<h2>faults in a power system</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Generator failure resulting from insulation break down between turns in the same slot or between windings and te steel structure of the machines</li>
		<li>For the case of overhead lines since they have bear conductor, wind, birds, trees and damage of the support structures are a cause of faults</li>
		<li>Contamination of insulators and lightning overvoltage lead to short circuits</li>
		<li>Deterioration of insulation in underground cables also results into short circuits. This is mainly attributed to ageing and overloading of these cables</li>
		<li>They can also arise from mal operation by the network operators</li>
	</ul>
